# CohortAnalysis
Working with sns.heatmap
1. Build a script (R, Python, SQL...) to create a cohort of signup to order placement and show the result. The goal of this cohort is to see, out of the users that signed up in week n, how many placed an order in week n+1, n+2, n+3...
As an input, you have 2 tables:
- one with user_id, signup_timestamp
- and a second one with user_id, order_timestamp
